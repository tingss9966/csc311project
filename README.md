# csc311project
This is the repository for a CSC311 machine learning final project.

For some files there are comment out sections that we used to plot graph or finding the best parameters.
when running the files please comment out these section if they have not been comment out for you.
(If nothing goes wrong, they should be commented out)
If you want to run these part of our code, please keep in mind that most of them are very time-consuming.
especially the comment out section in part B ensemble.
#Part A
Run each file by going to each file and run main.

For the 3 question to either implement matrix factorization or neural network, we chose to implement neural network.

# Part B
Part B we have implemented ensemble to increase the accuracy of the algorithm. 
In order to get the best accuracy, please run the ensemble file rather than the neural network improved.
You can run the neural network improved to see how it differs from what we have implemented in part A.
